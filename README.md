# CropVision-AI-Powered-Plant-Disease-Detection
CropVision uses deep learning (CNNs) to automatically detect and classify plant diseases from images, achieving 93%+ accuracy. It reduces reliance on expert knowledge, helps monitor crop health, minimize losses, and supports sustainable agriculture.


## Objectives
- Automate detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases.
- Reduce manual effort in plant disease monitoring.
- Provide a reliable tool for farmers and agricultural researchers.
- Improve prediction accuracy using deep learning and pre-trained models.

## Literature Survey
- Early approaches relied on image processing and manual feature extraction.
- Machine learning techniques such as SVM, DLQP, and k-FLBPCM have been applied for classification.
- CNN-based approaches, especially **Faster-RCNN with ResNet-34**, enhance localization and classification accuracy.
- Challenges include varying leaf sizes, lighting, noise, and similarity between healthy and diseased areas.

## Proposed System
1. **Data Acquisition**: Images collected from PlantVillage dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images resized and normalized for uniform input.
3. **Feature Extraction & Classification**: CNN (LeNet variant) with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers to extract features and classify diseases.

### Architecture
- Convolutional layers extract hierarchical features.
- Max pooling reduces spatial dimensions.
- Fully connected layers and softmax activation perform classification.
- Pre-trained weights enhance accuracy.

### Working
- Input images resized to 128Ã—128.
- CNN extracts features via Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout.
- Flattened feature maps feed into dense layers for classification.
- Output provides predicted disease class.
